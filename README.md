### Comments

- I did not have access to any of the Sketch or Figma files, but I aimed to be as pixel perfect as possible.

- In the provided example images, it looks like there is some padding on the left and right of the text, where the text is not perfectly in line with the image, so I included a wrapping element with padding and then offset this with negative margin for the image wrapper.
